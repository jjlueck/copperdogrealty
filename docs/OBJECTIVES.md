## Copper Dog Realty Website

Create a unique website for **Copper Dog Realty**, a boutique real estate brokerage in Milford, Iowa serving the Iowa Great Lakes/Okoboji region.

**The Unique Concept:**
The website will blend the aesthetics of a dog shelter with a real estate brokerage. Property listings will be presented like rescue dogs waiting for adoption - creating a warm, approachable experience that reflects the company's namesake (the loyal, friendly dachshund).

**Key Features:**

- **Home page** - Announcing the new business and establishing the brand identity
- **Property listings** - Homes and business spaces presented with the "rescue dog" approach
- **Team member pages** - Individual profiles for each real estate agent
- **Brand personality** - Small-town warmth, integrity, community focus, and personalized service

**Design Direction:**
The aesthetic should feel welcoming and trustworthy, combining professional real estate expertise with the heartwarming, approachable feel of a dog rescue. The goal is to make real estate shopping feel as comfortable and exciting as finding a new furry companion.

This is a creative and memorable approach that will help Copper Dog Realty stand out in the market while staying true to their community-focused values.
